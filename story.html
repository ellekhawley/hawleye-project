          <h2>Their Story</h2>
          <div class="story-content">
            <p>Liza grew up in Wisconsin, while Jordan was raised in Minnesota—two very different upbringings that somehow led them to the same path. Jordan originally planned to attend Stout but made a last-minute decision to transfer to Eau Claire, which turned out to be one of the best choices of his life. Liza had just come through a difficult summer before meeting him, not knowing that something truly special was around the corner. Now, years later, they’ve built a beautiful life together in Madison, with stable jobs, two sweet cats, and a lovable dog named Maple they adopted as a team. They’ve moved through several houses, but through every transition, their love and commitment to each other have remained unwavering.</p>

          <h2>How They Met</h2>
          <img class="timeline" src="images/timeline.png" alt="Liza and Jordan relationship timeline">
          <p>Their love story officially began on Tinder, probably one of the only real Tinder success stories out there. Neither of them expected much from a dating app, but they quickly found themselves talking non-stop during winter break, even while away from their dorms. Once they returned to campus, they wasted no time spending every day together, hanging out at each other’s places and quickly becoming part of one another’s lives. They met each other's friends and family early on, and it just felt easy and natural. Over time, they grew even closer, especially during the pandemic when they lived together through the chaos of COVID. It was a true test of their relationship, but they came out stronger, proving to themselves and everyone else that their love is built to last.</p>
