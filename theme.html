                <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                <p>Liza has always dreamed of incorporating shades of green into her wedding, and since Jordan shares a deep love for plants and nature, the theme came together naturally. Their main color palette centers around rich, dark greens to reflect this shared passion, complemented by touches of soft pinks and deep reds to add contrast and keep the design from feeling too uniform. When selecting fonts, they wanted a balance of elegance and readability, choosing one serif-style font paired with a cursive script. They were especially careful with the script font, making sure it remained clear and easy to read for all guests, including older family and friends, while the serif font was chosen simply because it complemented the script beautifully. The overall decor will lean heavily into lush, plant-inspired elements with a timeless feel, especially for the reception. Luckily, the historic and stunning architecture of their reception venue will provide much of the atmosphere, so the decor can remain simple yet elegant, letting the natural beauty of the space shine through.</p>
